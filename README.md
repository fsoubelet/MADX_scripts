# MAD-X Scripts

## Contents

This directory contains various MAD-X masks for studies in my work.

The directory includes the following sub-directories:
- `AC_dipole_tracking`: scripts used for tracking under AC dipole motion and free oscillations to investigate sextupolar amplitude detuning.
- `full_template`: a very extensive template to adapt from, that includes many types of effects and scenarios, including for tracking.
- `Local_Coupling`: scripts used for studies of local IR coupling in various circumstances.
