# MAD-X Scripts

## Contents

This directory contains various MAD-X masks for studies in my work.

The directory includes the following sub-directories:
- `AC_dipole_tracking`: templates for tracking under AC dipole motion and free oscillations to investigate sextupolar amplitude detuning.
- `full_template`: very extensive template to adapt from, that includes many types of effects and scenarios for tracking.
- `Local_Coupling`: templates for studies of local coupling at IP1 in various circumstances, with attempts at correcting them.
